# Discord-Python-Server-Control-Panel
This repository contains a Discord admin control panel bot for managing a multi-map ARK cluster and a Palworld server. The bot exposes a slash-command driven UI that lets authorized staff monitor server status, send start/stop/restart/update commands, manage bans cluster-wide, and capture Ark Server Manager snapshots directly from Discord.
